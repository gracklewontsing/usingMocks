1.    Explain what happened with variables annotated as @Mock
- Mock variables are generated without parameters and don't need to be constructed, as they are mock files to simulate variables that might be instantiated.
 It's helpful in case variables require connections with databases. Mocks aren't saved.
2.    What is the purpose of the tuple when/thenReturn?
- when one of the tuples's parameter is called, thenreturn assigns a value, as the parameter holds no value.
3.    What is the difference of the objects annotated as @Mock and @Spy?
- Spy objects have to be constructed. Mock objects are 'hollow' in this sense.
4.    When is useful to use the @InjectMocks annotation?
- When needing to mock properties of a class, such that you can manipulate parameters you need.
5.    Give an example of a scenario when is a good idea to use Mocks
-   If variables require database data and there is no requirement for data to be populated from the database.
    You can avoid the connection and fetching processes to test directly.
    Also, if stating parameters is not required for testing purposes.
